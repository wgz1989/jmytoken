# About JMY Token

The JMY Token protocol, created by JMY Token Inc., facilitates the exchange of files between untrusted parties. Its primary limitation is that collaborations between parties using the protocol cannot persist over time, inhibiting the exchange. Blockchain technologies allow for collaborations between untrusted parties to persist over much longer periods of time. JMY Token has the ecosystem and expertise necessary to integrate blockchain technologies into the JMY Token protocol. Doing so would both eliminate the protocolâ€™s existing flaw as well as open up a new borderless economy in exchanging value for computing resources on a global scale. 
To accomplish this, TRON Foundation and JMY Token Foundation are introducing a new cryptographic token, called JMY, along with an extended version of the JMY Token protocol. Together, the token and extended protocol will create a token-based economy for networking, bandwidth and storage usage. The initial entry point is to introduce token-based optimizations to the existing JMY Token protocol, providing a way for the value of shared bandwidth to be captured by network participants. The longer-term vision is to broaden the usage of the JMY Token protocol far beyond current use cases by providing a distributed infrastructure platform to third-party app developers, creating the foundation for the decentralized web.
